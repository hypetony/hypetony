### Virtual Experience Data Analytics Consulting Program Participant - KPMG
Recently, I completed the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Consulting Internship, an experience that defied conventional learning methods by emphasizing self-driven exploration and problem-solving. The program revolved around three pivotal tasks: Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights, and Data Presentation, all centred on a provided business dataset encompassing customer demographics, transactions, and more.

One of the most striking aspects was the emphasis on self-learning. Participants could choose their preferred technology and platform to tackle tasks effectively. The internship's structure encouraged autonomy, allowing for trial and error, enabling personal growth through research and learning from mistakes.

The internship felt like a miniature professional project, emphasizing technical proficiency and effective communicationâ€”a crucial skill in corporate environments.

In detail, the tasks involved:

Module 1: Data Quality Assessment
This phase required identifying data quality issues within the provided datasets, proposing solutions to rectify discrepancies, and ensuring smoother analyses in the future. Proficiency in Excel, especially the filter tool and other functions, was essential. Communication skills were key, as findings needed to be conveyed effectively to the client via email.

Module 2: Data Insights
Here, the focus was on extracting insights about potential customers by analyzing past behaviour. Strategies included evaluating age distribution, recent purchase patterns, industry categories, wealth segments, and more. Presenting these findings to assist the client in selecting target customers was a crucial aspect of this task.

Module 3: Data Presentation
The final task involved creating a dashboard using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Excel to visually represent findings from previous tasksâ€”showcasing target customers, top-selling goods, customer demographics, and spending habits.

I'm immensely grateful to KPMG and Inside Sherpa for orchestrating this brilliantly crafted data analytics virtual consulting experience. It offered an incredible platform to delve into real-world scenarios and enhance technical and communication skills in a dynamic learning environment.

### Virtual Experience Technology Consulting Program Participant -  Deloitte
During my internship, I delved into real-world scenarios that mirror the challenges consultants face while collaborating with clients. The program encompassed three key modules, each targeting critical areas:

Module 1 â€“ Technology Strategy & Innovation:
Focused on a client's ambition to venture into online banking, my role involved comprehensive client discovery, crafting a tailored business case, and devising strategies for smooth mobilization and implementation. This module honed my skills in critical thinking, value analysis, feasibility assessment, and precise cost estimation.

Module 2 â€“ Optimization & Delivery:
This module revolved around identifying the ideal financial accounting system for a client. It tasked me with delineating the project approach, conducting an extensive market analysis, and ultimately presenting a solution. Evaluating eight distinct accounting systems enhanced my prowess in project planning, market research, capability assessment, and meticulous implementation planning.

Module 3 â€“ Cloud Engineering:
Centred on the advantages and considerations of implementing cloud computing for clients, this module explored the potential benefits and associated risks. Through understanding cloud computing intricacies, conducting feasibility and readiness assessments, and presenting a detailed assessment report, I cultivated skills in rigorous research, risk assessment, and prioritizing application needs.

These modules have not only equipped me with practical experience but also enriched my skill set with a comprehensive understanding of technology strategy, optimization methodologies, and cloud engineering's transformative potential for businesses.
